# Going to Boston

## How do you play Going to Boston?
The game is played in an agreed-upon number of rounds.

Each player in turn has three throws of the dice.

On the first throw, the highest number is put to one side. If two or more of the dice show the highest number, only one is kept. The remaining two dice are thrown and once again the highest-numbered dice is put aside. The final dice is then rolled and the total of all three dice is the player’s score.

## How do you win the game?
When all players have had a turn, the player with the highest score wins the round. Ties are broken by additional rounds of rolling. When all rounds have been played, the player who won the most rounds is the overall winner.

## Are there any rule variations?
Yes. One variant is called Multiplication. It's played the same as Going to Boston, except instead of adding the total of all three dice, a player’s score is determined by scoring the sum of the first two dice multiplied by the third.
